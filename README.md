## Circonstances to write this code:

  As exercise for the fifth week in a python cours. It is a telework week. we have to use new theories teached, we have to carry out a project which contain two main parts the first one is to code the game of casino and the second part we have to import functions and variables.

  Every student should rely on his self to plannify his working time via Trello account and usecase plan.
  We had to be able to use files and import diffrent data.


## Casino game rules:

- The user lance the program and choice the amount thqt he will play with.
- He make choice of numbers from 0 to 49.
- The computer also make a random choice.
- If the chosen number is an even number, the color is red else his color is black.

-The machine will compare and give the result of the new amount of money according the following rules:

      * If the player choice the same number that the machine has chosen, he triples his bet.
      * If the color of the player number is the same of that machine, he obtain only the half of his bet.
      * If colors are diffrent, the player will lost all his bet.

- When the player loses, we ask him if he want to paly again and we ask the amount of money he will

## Goals acheived:

- Defining functions
- calling a function from an other file
- calling a function in an other function
- import data files
